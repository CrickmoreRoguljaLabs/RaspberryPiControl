Raspberry Pi Control

This is just a Tkinter-based GUI for controlling multiple Raspberry Pis which are running our usual experimental optogenetic protocols. It includes timers for each well and a history of commands issued. It's ugly but it works.

I plan on introducing streams of the videos from each Pi at some point, but haven't yet. I also hope to introduce the ability to customize the aliases etc. for each Raspberry Pi
